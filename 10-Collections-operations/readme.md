### How to edit a collection.. Darn simple.. hence not coding it..

* We can us set to change the model directly and it ll reflect in the collection.

* Use get and then set if we only have access to collection for editing.

### Events on Collection

* Can be use to get notified when a collection is changes in any way..
* Works exactly as model Events.. Hence not coding it..
